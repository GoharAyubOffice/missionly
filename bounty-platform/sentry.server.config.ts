// This file configures the initialization of Sentry for edge features (middleware, edge routes, and so on).
// The config you add here will be used whenever one of the edge features is loaded.
// Note that this config is unrelated to the Vercel Edge Runtime and is also required when running locally.

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // ...

  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
